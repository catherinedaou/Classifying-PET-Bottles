# Classifying Images of PET Bottles

This is a Python project that trains a simple Support Vector Classifier that classifies 6 types of PET bottles. 

The dataset used is made up of 852 images of 6 types of bottles. Below is a list of the bottles with how many images there are of each:

* Bottle 250ml: 11
* Bottle 330ml: 113
* Bottle 500ml: 300
* Bottle 1000ml: 85
* Bottle 1500ml: 309
* Bottle 2000ml: 34

The SVC model trained had an accuracy of 90%.
